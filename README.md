# **CODE INSTITUTE: MILESTONE PROJECT 4** #

# **DELI SW** #

![site display on different screens](readme/images/testing/responsive.png)

This is the fourth, and final, Milestone Project for the Full Stack Web Development course provided by Code Institute. The main goal for this project was to produce a "full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. You will set up an authentication mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data and/or activitied based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product/service." The site is to be built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Django, MySQL or Postgres, Stripe  and any other relevant libraries and external API's.

A live version of the site can be found [here](https://milestone-4-delisw.herokuapp.com/).

## **UX** ##

### <ins>PROJECT GOALS</ins> ###

The main aim of this website is to provide the **user** with an online delicatessan showcasing the food and drink on offer from the South West of England. 6 Counties have been included: Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Somerset and Wiltshire, and the site is flexible enough to add further Categories, Counties and, of course, Products when needed. The **site owner** has the ability to add event postings to the site which will allow further promotion of the products available to the **user** from this part of the country.

## **DATABASE DESIGN** ##

4 collections were used for the construction of the database in MongoDB.
The collection used the most was **recipes** as it holds the majority of the information required to display information on the DOM.
There are associations with the following:

- **categories** to **recipes**
  - category_name

- **cookbooks** to **recipes**
  - cookbook_name

- **users** to **recipes**
  - username

### products app ###

### category model ###

| Name | Database Key | Field Type | Type Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Name | name  | CharField | max_length=254 |
| Friendly Name | friendly_name | CharField | max_length=254 |

### county model ###

| Name | Database Key | Field Type | Type Validation |
